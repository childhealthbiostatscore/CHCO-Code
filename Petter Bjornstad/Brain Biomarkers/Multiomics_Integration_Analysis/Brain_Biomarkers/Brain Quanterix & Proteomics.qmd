### Methods

Pool data from from 69 youth participants from CROCODILE (n = 47; lean controls, LC, and Type 1 Diabetes, T1D) & PENGUIN (n = 22; Polycystic Kidney Disease, PKD) with plasma proteomics and quanterix brain biomarkers.

Pooled data from 66 youth participants from RENAL-HEIR (n = 23; obese controls, OB, and Type 2 Diabetes, T2D) and the followup study, RENAL-HEIRitage (n = 43; OB & T2D) with serum proteomics and quanterix brain biomarkers.

A total of 142 participants across all four studies had brain biomarkers, and of those, 135 also have proteomics data from serum or plasma.

We assessed the data for the assumptions of linear regression by regressing each brain biomarker on each proteins and inspecting the residuals for linearity, normality, and heteroskedasticity, independently for the plasma proteomics cohorts (CROCODILE & PENGUIN) and the serum proteomics cohorts (RH/RH2).
