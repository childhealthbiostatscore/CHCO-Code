# Data cleaning

- Participants from the Chicago site or with an asterisk in their study ID were excluded.

```{r}
create_report(diagnostic_labs,
  output_file = "OneDrive/Vigers/BDC/Janet Snell-Bergeon/CALICO/Reports/diagnostic_labs_eda.html",
  config = configure_report(
    plot_correlation_args = list("cor_args" = list(use = "pairwise.complete.obs"))
  )
)
```

# Notes

- An asterisk in subject ID indicates that there are data issues currently being worked on. Probably exclude these for now.

# Table
